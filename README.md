# VBA-challenge
This is my VBA Challenge
This is my frist time using excel VBA and I must confess it was a bit of a challenge to me as I have had to visit over and over again as the results i was getting was not the same as the one in the starter code provided in the assignment package.

The Script was written in such a way that it looped through all the 3 excel sheets to do the following:
- outputs the ticker symbol,
- outputs the change in price (i.e., closing price - openining price),
- outputs the percentage change in price from the opening price and,
- outputs the total stock volume.
Additionally a functionality was added to the script to retuen the greatest percentage increase, the greatest percentage decrease as well as the total volume together with their appropriate ticker symbol and values.

The work for view has `final` attached to it and running it for all the 3 years, the following screenshots were taken:
